<h1>Советы по подготовке презентации</h1>
<p>Презентацию можно сделать в 3D. Для этого часть графических элементов слайда сделать черно-белыми, собранных из двух цветных слоев: общий для всех трехмерных элементов слой — красный, 60% прозрачности; по отдельному для каждого трехмерного элемента слою — зеленому, 40% прозрачности. Если сдвигать зеленые слои вправо — элементы будут приближаться к зрителю в 3D-очках. Если сдвигать влево — будут удаляться. Чем больше сдвигаешь тем глубже трехмерный эффект.<img src="/labs/a/img/marcom/3d-oresentation-in-omnigraffle.jpg" width="650" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Structuring Your Talk</h2>
<p>Preparing a talk always takes far longer than you anticipate.  Start early!</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a clear statement of the problem and its importance.</li>
<li>Research. Collect material which may relate to the topic.</li>
<li>Tell a story in a logical sequence.</li>
<li>Stick to the key concepts. Avoid description of specifics and unnecessary details. </li>
<li>If you are making a series of points, organize them from the most to the least important. The less important points can be skipped if you run short of time.</li>
<li>Keep your sentences short, about 10-20 words each is ideal. This is the way people usually talk.</li>
<li>Strive for clarity. Are these the best words for making your point? Are they unambiguous? Are you using unfamiliar jargon or acronyms?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparing Your Slides</h2>
<h3>Presentation Design</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't overload your slides with too much text or data.</li>
<li>FOCUS. In general, using a few powerful slides is the aim.</li>
<li>Let the picture or graphic tell the story. Avoid text.</li>
<li>Type key words in the PowerPoint Notes area listing what to say when displaying the slide. The notes are printable.</li>
<li>Number your slides and give them a title.</li>
<li>Use the &quot;summary slide&quot; feature in slide sorter view to prepare an Agenda or Table of Contents slide.</li>
<li>Prepare a company logo slide for your presentation.</li>
<li>You can add a logo and other graphics to every slide using the slide master feature.</li>
<li>Proof read everything, including visuals and numbers.</li>
<li>Keep &quot;like&quot; topics together</li>
<li>Strive for similar line lengths for text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual elements</h3>
<ul>
<li>A font size of 28 to 34 with a bold font is recommended for subtitles. The title default size is 44. Use a san serif font for titles.</li>
<li>Use clear, simple visuals. Don't confuse the audience.</li>
<li>Use contrast: light on dark or dark on light.</li>
<li>Graphics should make a key concept clearer.</li>
<li>Place your graphics in a similar location within each screen.</li>
<li>To temporarily clear the screen press W or B during the presentation. Press Enter to resume the presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Text</h3>
<ul>
<li>Font size must be large enough to be easily read. Size 28 to 34 with a bold font is recommended.</li>
<li>It is distracting if you use too wide a variety of fonts.</li>
<li>Overuse of text is a common mistake.<br />
o Too much text makes the slide unreadable. You may just as well show a blank slide. Stick to a few key words. <br />
o If your audience is reading the slides they are not paying attention to you. If possible, make your point with graphics instead of text.<br />
o You can use Word Art, or a clip art image of a sign, to convey text in a more interesting way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Numbers are usually confusing to the audience. Use as few as possible and allow extra time for the audience to do the math.</li>
<li>Numbers should never be ultra precise: <br />
o &quot;Anticipated Revenues of $660,101.83&quot; looks silly. Are your numbers that accurate? Just say $660 thousand.<br />
o &quot;The Break Even Point is 1048.17 units. Are you selling fractions of a unit?<br />
o Don't show pennies. Cost per unit is about the only time you would need to show pennies.</li>
<li>If you have more than 12-15 numbers on a slide, that's probably too many.</li>
<li>Using only one number per sentence helps the audience absorb the data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the same scale for numbers on a slide. Don't compare thousands to millions.</li>
<li>When using sales data, stick to a single market in the presentation. Worldwide sales, domestic sales, industry sales, company sales, divisional sales, or sales to a specific market segment are all different scales. They should not be mixed.</li>
<li>Cite your source on the same slide as the statistic, using a smaller size font.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charts need to be clearly labeled. You can make more interesting charts by adding elements from the drawing toolbar.</li>
<li>Numbers in tables are both hard to see and to understand. There is usually a better way to present your numerical data than with columns and rows of numbers. Get creative!</li>
<li>PowerPoint deletes portions of charts and worksheets that are imported from Excel, keeping only the leftmost 5.5 inches. Plan ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backgrounds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backgrounds should never distract from the presentation.</li>
<li>Using the default white background is hard on the viewer's eyes. You can easily add a design style or a color to the background.</li>
<li>Backgrounds that are light colored with dark text, or vice versa, look good. A dark background with white font reduces glare.</li>
<li>Colors appear lighter when projected. Pale colors often appear as white.</li>
<li>Consistent backgrounds add to a professional appearance.</li>
<li>For a long presentation, you may want to change background designs when shifting to a new topic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Excitement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slides for business presentations should be dull! You don't want to distract the audience.</li>
<li>Sounds and transition effects can be annoying. Use sparingly.</li>
<li>Animation effects can be interesting when used in moderation.<br />
o Too much animation is distracting.<br />
o Consider using animated clip art<br />
o Consider using custom animation</li>
<li>You can insert video and audio clips into PowerPoint.</li>
<li>You can also insert hyperlinks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints for Efficient Practice</h2>
<h3>Timing - Practicing Your Presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk through your presentation to see how much time you use for each slide.</li>
<li>Set the automatic slide transition to the amount of time you want to spend discussing each slide.</li>
<li>Are you using the right amount of time per slide? Decide which slides or comments need alteration to make your presentation smoother.</li>
<li>Change the automatic slide transition settings for individual slides to fit the amount of time needed for that slide and practice again. Are you still within the time limit?</li>
<li>Decide if you want to remove the automatic slide transition feature before giving the presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of key words/concepts for each slide</li>
<li>Read through the list before you begin.</li>
<li>Don't attempt to memorize your text;</li>
<li>Your words will probably be different each time you practice.</li>
<li>Think about the ideas, and your words will follow naturally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Delivering Your Talk</h2>
<h3>Pre-Talk Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan to get there a few minutes early to set up and test the equipment.</li>
<li>Dress appropriately for your audience.</li>
<li>Turn off your cell phone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Handouts: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Edward Tufte, the leading expert on visual presentation techniques, advises speakers to always prepare a handout when giving a PowerPoint presentation.</li>
<li>Make about 10% more handouts than you expect to use.</li>
<li>Distribute handouts at the beginning of your talk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opening:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jump right in and get to the point.</li>
<li>Give your rehearsed opening statement; don't improvise at the last moment.</li>
<li>Use the opening to catch the interest and attention of the audience.</li>
<li>Briefly state the problem or topic you will be discussing.</li>
<li>Briefly summarize your main theme for an idea or solution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Speaking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk at a natural, moderate rate of speech</li>
<li>Project your voice.</li>
<li>Speak clearly and distinctly.</li>
<li>Repeat critical information.</li>
<li>Pause briefly to give your audience time to digest the information on each new slide.</li>
<li>Don't read the slides aloud. Your audience can read them far faster than you can talk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Body Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep your eyes on the audience</li>
<li>Use natural gestures.</li>
<li>Don't turn your back to the audience.</li>
<li>Don't hide behind the lectern.</li>
<li>Avoid looking at your notes. Only use them as reference points to keep you on track. Talk, don't read.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always leave time for a few questions at the end of the talk.</li>
<li>If you allow questions during the talk, the presentation time will be about 25% more than the practice time.</li>
<li>You can jump directly to a slide by typing its number or by right-clicking during the presentation and choosing from the slide titles.</li>
<li>Relax. If you've done the research you can easily answer most questions.</li>
<li>Some questions are too specific or personal. Politely refuse to answer. </li>
<li>If you can't answer a question, say so. Don't apologize.  &quot;I don't have that information. I'll try to find out for you.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Length:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To end on time, you must PRACTICE!</li>
<li>When practicing, try to end early. You need to allow time for audience interruptions and questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Demeanor:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show some enthusiasm. Nobody wants to listen to a dull presentation. On the other hand, don't overdo it. Nobody talks and gestures like a maniac in real life. How would you explain your ideas to a friend?</li>
<li>Involve your audience. Ask questions, make eye contact, use humor.</li>
<li>Don't get distracted by audience noises or movements.</li>
<li>You'll forget a minor point or two. Everybody does.</li>
<li>If you temporarily lose your train of thought you can gain time to recover by asking if the audience has any questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Close the sale.</li>
<li>Concisely summarize your key concepts and the main ideas of your presentation.</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to add a few last impromptu words.</li>
<li>End your talk with the summary statement or question you have prepared. What do you want them to do? What do you want them to remember?</li>
<li>Consider alternatives to &quot;Questions?&quot; for your closing slide. A summary of your key points, a cartoon, a team logo, or a company logo may be stronger. </li>
</ul>
