<body>
<p>A company that is looking to get bids from several qualified  vendors for a Web site design or development project will typically  write a Request for Proposal (RFP) and either post it online or send it  directly to potential vendors it has identified.</p>
<p>As with any  complex project, a Web site design project requires clear communication  between the client and web developer in order for the client to receive  accurate bids. The RFP serves as a baseline of project requirements on  which competing vendors may price their services. I have outlined a few  items below that should typically be in a Website Design and Development  Request for Proposal, though some times more information is necessary.</p>
<p>Writing your Request for Proposal</p>
<p>The  Request for Proposal (RFP) process allows potential vendors to get an  idea of your goals, existing challenges and possible limitations without  lengthy phone discussions or in-person meetings that can severely  impact the amount of time it takes for you to get started with your Web  Design and Development project. It allows you to succinctly describe  exactly what you are looking for and what a potential vendor should  expect in the project.</p>
<p>An ideal RFP would clearly specify all the  requirements pertaining to your website. It would allow the developer to  present you with a proposal based your particular needs and, needless  to say, the more details your RFP contains, the more accurate a proposal  the developer is able to present.</p>
<p>Components of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Web site Design and Development Project:</p>
<p>Project Background Information</p>
<ul>
<li>Brief overview of your organization, including some history and your primary business objectives.</li>
<li>Detailed description of the project you would like to receive the proposal for.</li>
<li>If your budget requirements are strict, it might help to include a  'Ballpark' Budget - which developers can use to scope and scale your  solution and save you time.</li>
<li>Target launch date and required deliverable dates - include any  dates that you need the project to meet. Are there crucial meetings and  cut-off dates that the developer should be aware of? If you are not sure  what the time frame should be, it's okay to see what the proposals you  receive recommend and renegotiate. It's also good to anticipate and  state how flexible you are with the project's completion date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing Requirements and Data</p>
<ul>
<li>Audience demographics - who will be the main users of your site? Are  there several different audiences that need to be addressed?</li>
<li>User comfort level with technology -  how technically savvy is  your audience? Will they know how to deal with plug-ins, for example?</li>
<li>Will users have high-speed connections, or will many be on modems?</li>
<li>Audience base -  how large do you expect your user base to be?</li>
</ul>
<p>Design and Corporate Branding Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have corporate identity guidelines that must be followed, including fonts and colors and graphic treatments?</li>
<li>What look and feel to you envision for the Web site? Include some adjectives to describe what your site should communicate.</li>
<li>Provide examples of Web sites that relate to the RFP either  because they have a similar feel to the one your are looking for, or  even examples of what you do NOT want.</li>
<li>Will there be any animated elements (i.e. Flash animations)? How many? How are they going to be used?</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical and Infrastructure Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>Web hosting considerations. Do you currently have a Web host or are you looking for a new one to handle this project?</li>
<li>Browser/platform considerations. Generally speaking, a Web site  for consumers or the general public should work similarly across all  modern browsers and Operating Systems. If you are targeting a very  specific audience it is possible your needs are different.</li>
<li>Development platform requirements. Do you require an Open Source  solution, are you open to a proprietary solution that is more tailored  to your exact needs, etc.</li>
<li>Coding language requirements (e.g. ASP.NET, PHP, Java). Many times  this depends on the type of Web hosting platform or any pre-existing  software you may have.</li>
<li>Are there third party applications you'd like to incorporate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Functionality/programming Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>Will there be forms on the site? If so, how many? How should they be  handled? (e.g. e-mailed to recipients, stored in a database, etc.)</li>
<li>Will the site require tools to manage content/information (e.g.  ability for staff to add content such as press releases or quarterly  reports)?</li>
<li>Will there be any e-commerce on the site? If so, who will be  entering data on products offered? How will transactions be managed?</li>
<li>Are there any other interactive features the site should have? What are they, and how do you envision them to work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Search Engine Optimization</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe any currently defined search engine friendly production requirements and expectations</li>
<li>Indicate if you are seeking SEO/SEM consultation services</li>
</ul>
<p>Ongoing Site Maintenance Plans</p>
<ul>
<li>How often will the site be updated? Are you looking for a retainer situation, or 'on-demand' hourly work?</li>
<li>Will you be self-maintaining or will you be outsourcing maintenance services?</li>
</ul>
<p>Project Management</p>
<ul>
<li>Who will be the main point of contact on your staff? Keep in mind  that in most cases it is easiest to have a single point of contact at  both your organization and the company designing and developing your Web  site.</li>
<li>How will the tasks be divided between you and the developer in order to complete the project?</li>
<li>Are there any third parties (subcontractors, etc.) that will also be involved in the project?</li>
</ul>
<p>RFP Response Deadline and Contact Information</p>
<ul>
<li>When is the response to the RFP due?</li>
<li>To whom should the response be sent?</li>
<li>Do you prefer E-mail or hard copies, and if so, how many hard copies?</li>
<li>Is there a specific solicitation number that needs to be referenced in the Proposal Document?</li>
<li>What is the RFP review process? How long do you anticipate to take to make your decision before the project can begin?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Additional Thoughts Before You Begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all items listed above, be sure to clearly indicate if you must  have any item(s) bid as an optional aspect of the project. Keep in mind  possible dependencies between project aspect/components that may make  this impractical.</li>
<li>Before writing your Request For Proposal, determine your budget  for the project and, beyond that, your priorities for selecting a  Developer who can meet your budgetary requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing an RFP is a good exercise for anyone thinking  about a site design or redesign as it takes thoughtful planning to  specify and construct a website. A well thought out, quality RFP is  essential to a successful endeavor because it helps you to focus on your  goals and exactly how to achieve them.</p>
<p>Best of luck with your Web site Design and Development Project.</p>
