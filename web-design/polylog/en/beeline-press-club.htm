<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p class="caption">After the rebranding of Vimpelcom in 2006, one of the main tasks for the company's press service was expanding its pool of loyal media. To accomplish this, Vimpelcom brought in Polylog to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Russia's first corporate press club, valuable and interesting for journalists</li>
<li>Expand the company's thematic range in media coverage</li>

<li>Further develop telecom journalism in the regions</li>
</ol>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p><img src="/a/projects/polylog/img/projects/press-club-01.jpg" alt="Press Club" class="left" height="203" width="319" />Press club meetings are organized using the results of a study targeting telecom journalists — gatherings of colleagues joined by industry experts to strengthen the informational content of the discussions. At each meeting journalists are given a press kit with materials on the main topic of discussion.  Meetings are held at popular beer gardens and, in addition to informational content, include entertainment and club events.</p>

<p>The club has its own LiveJournal <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/telecom_press/" target="_blank">weblog</a>, with content created and moderated by Vimpelcom.</p>
