<p>Any password you create for Joomla!, MySQL, Apache, or in fact any passwords you ever create, should be made as secure as possible. </p>
<p>Typically this would mean: </p>
<ul>
<li>using a minimum of 6 characters - the more the better but 8-10 should be an ideal /* design */</li>
<li>a mixture of upper and lower case alphabet characters, numbers, and permitted special characters for example <strong>-</strong>, <strong>_</strong>, <strong>*</strong>, <strong>$</strong>, <strong>!</strong>, <strong>%</strong>, although the use of these may be governed by the host settings on shared or virtual hosted, remote servers </li>
<li>do not use easily identifiable passwords for example, birthdays, children's or family names, or words that could be easily associated with you /* computer graphics*/</li>
<li>in fact try not to use real words at all, replace letters with their numeric <em>equal</em> so the word ocean could become 0c34n (yes – I know it is a real word and there are only 5 characters but it is just an example) try 0c34n!c – and no do not now use that either </li>
<li>another way is to think entirely <em>off-the-wall. </em>Think of a favourite novel for example, <u>T</u>h<u>e</u> <u>H</u>itch-hiker<u>s</u> <u>G</u>uid<u>e</u> <u>to</u> <u>t</u>h<u>e</u> <u>G</u>alax<u>y</u>, and then take say the first and last letter from each word giving a sequence of letters (as indicated by the underscores):<br />
Example 1: <strong>t e h s g e t o t e g y</strong><br />
this clearly means absolutely nothing but it could still be traced – eventually – by a determined cracker so let us mix it up a bit more: <br />
Example 2:<strong> T 3 h $ 9 3 t 0 T 3 g Y</strong><br />
(again ignore the spaces) but you can now see that it would be a pretty <em>illogical</em> logic that would need to be applied to even come close to cracking that and when the additional security features of the various platforms is then laid over the top of this – we would not want to say it is impossible to crack, but they would take a very long time, </li>
<li> /* computer graphics*/ you should regularly change your passwords certainly on critical sites </li>
<li>if you keep a written record of your passwords, always ensure they too are /* design */ kept secure and safely out of the way of prying eyes </li>
<li>despite the temptation, try to avoid using the same password for all your various access requirements, both at home and at work</li>
</ul>
